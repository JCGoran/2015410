<p>Compile
the mod files with mknrndll (mswin or graphical mac) or nrnivmodl
(unix/linux)). Start the simulation by (unix/linux) typing on the
command line:</p>
<p>nrngui
mosinit.hoc</p>
<p>or
(mac os x) drag and dropping the mosinit.hoc file on the nrngui icon
or (mswin) double clicking on the mosinit.hoc file.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
Click on the buttons "ctrl vs CaN block," "ctrl vs BK block," and "ctrl vs BK block vs & BK/CaN block" to replicate respectively the simulations shown in the left, center, and right panels of Figure 8B. Next, modify the parameter "cancoeff_bk2" to 0 and repeat the aforementioned steps
 to reproduce the previous simulations but without coupling between N-type VGCCs and BK CAKCs, as shown in Figure 8C.</p>
<p>The
simulations will reproduce the effects of coupling between BK CAKCs and N-type VGCCs in a
biophysically accurate model.</p>
